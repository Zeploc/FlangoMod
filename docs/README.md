# Ideas
## Fizzle Block
- Lil tube in box
  - Custom model
  - Base square outside
  - Inside tube - similar to piston
- Create from basic resources (non mod based)
- Add resources to it - Block Entity
  - When has enough, changes visual on block (outside ring pops up?)
- Pop down steps until primed - Block state
  - Plays sound on each push down (pitch increased based on distance)
  - Right click with specific resource - Flint?
- is "Primed" once it's fully down
- Based on where fizzle block based on top of, influences how good the drops/fizzle will be
- UI can display fizzle strength
- Powers up then pop
  - Side flaps were vertical pop down like clamps
  - Explodes
  - Drops a few items - Fuel - Fizzle Powder
  - Throws blocks that are a fizzle substance as blocks

## Fizzle substance
- If broken within tool drops fizzle powder
- With the proper tool, gives the real material, Fizzle Substance
- Burn substance? use powder to burn?
